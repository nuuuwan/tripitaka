As for heavenly beings, they are subject to greed, anger, and delusion, and so the information they give \u2014 especially with regard to the miracle of instruction \u2014 is not necessarily trustworthy. Thus the only valid basis for faith is the instruction that, when followed, brings about the end of one's own mental defilements.
