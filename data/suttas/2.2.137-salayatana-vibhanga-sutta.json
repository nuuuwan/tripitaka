      "text": "Despite the abstract format of this discourse, it deals with an emotional topic: the source of emotions, the use of the emotions in the course of the practice, and the ideal emotional state of a person who has completed the path and is fit to teach others. In particular, this discourse counters a common misperception: that the distress that comes from having an unachieved goal is an obstacle in the practice, and that the antidote for that distress is to renounce any sense of goals. In actuality, that distress \u2014 termed \"renunciation distress\" \u2014 has an important role in the practice: to overcome the distress that comes with a sense of loss over sensual pleasures that have not been attained, or those that have been attained in the past but now no longer exist. Renunciation distress serves as a reminder that the loss of sensual pleasures is not a serious matter. As for renunciation distress, it is overcome, not by abandoning any sense of goal, but by following the path and realizing the joy that comes when the goal is reached."

In actuality, renunciation equanimity serves a function as part of the path of practice \u2014 as a tool for letting go of renunciation joy \u2014 and then it, too, is transcended by the state called \"non-fashioning\" (atammayata), in which there is no act of intention, not even the intention underlying equanimity, at all."

The question in translating this compound is whether satta means \"living being\" or \"attached to.\" In this translation, I have opted for both.\n2.\nA person who \"has not conquered his limitations or the results of action\": this passage seems related to the passage in AN 3.99, which defines a person of limited mind, prey to the results of past bad actions, as one who is \"undeveloped in contemplating the body, undeveloped in virtue, undeveloped in concentration, and undeveloped in discernment; restricted, small-hearted, dwelling with suffering.\" As AN 3.99 points out, such a person suffers more intensely from the results of past unskillful actions than does one whose awareness is unrestricted. SN 42.8 recommends the practice of the four sublime attitudes as a way of developing an unrestricted awareness that weakens the results of past unskillful actions.\n3.\nA person who is \"blind to danger\" is one who does not see the drawbacks of sensual pleasure or attachment to the body. For such a person, moments of equanimity are usually a dull spot in the midst of the quest for sensual pleasure. This is why such moments do not go beyond the sensory stimulus that generated them.\n4.\nAtammayata. Literally, \"not-made-of-that-ness.\" See the introductions to sections II/B and III/G in The Wings to Awakening.\n"
