This is termed vi\u00f1\u00f1anam anidassanam \u2014 consciousness without a surface, or consciousness without feature. MN 49 says specifically that this consciousness does not partake of the \"allness of the all,\" the \"all\" being conterminous with the five aggregates. The standard definition of the aggregate of consciousness states that this aggregate includes all consciousness, \"past, present, or future... near or far.\" However, because vi\u00f1\u00f1anam anidassanam stands outside of space and time it would not be covered by these terms. Similarly, where SN 22.97 says that no consciousness is eternal, \"eternal\" is a concept that applies only within the dimension of time, and thus would not apply to this form of consciousness.\n2.\nDelineation (pa\u00f1\u00f1apana) literally means, \"making discernible.\" This apparently refers to the intentional aspect of perception, which takes the objective side of experience and fabricates it into discernible objects. In the case of the aggregates, the four great existents, contact, and name-&-form provide the objective basis for discerning them, while the process of fabrication takes the raw material provided by the objective basis and turns it into discernible instances of the aggregates. This process is described in slightly different terms in SN 22.79.\n"
