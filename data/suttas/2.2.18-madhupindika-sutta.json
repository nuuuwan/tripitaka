      "text": "This discourse plays a central role in the early Buddhist analysis of conflict. As might be expected, the blame for conflict lies within, in the unskillful habits of the mind, rather than without. The culprit in this case is a habit called papa\u00f1ca. Unfortunately, none of the early texts give a clear definition of what the word papa\u00f1ca means, so it's hard to find a precise English equivalent for the term. However, they do give a clear analysis of how papa\u00f1ca arises, how it leads to conflict, and how it can be ended. In the final analysis, these are the questions that matter \u2014 more than the precise definition of terms \u2014 so we will deal with them first before proposing a few possible translation equivalents for the word."

Sn 4.14 states that the root of the categories of papa\u00f1ca is the perception, \"I am the thinker.\" From this self-reflexive thought \u2014 in which one conceives a \"self,\" a thing corresponding to the concept of \"I\" \u2014 a number of categories can be derived: being/not-being, me/not-me, mine/not-mine, doer/done-to, signifier/signified. Once one's self becomes a thing under the rubric of these categories, it's impossible not to be assailed by the perceptions & categories derived from these basic distinctions. When there's the sense of identification with something that experiences, then based on the feelings arising from sensory contact, some feelings will seem appealing \u2014 worth getting for the self \u2014 and others will seem unappealing \u2014 worth pushing away. From this there grows desire, which comes into conflict with the desires of others who are also engaging in papa\u00f1ca. This is how inner objectifications breed external contention."

      "text": "How can this process be ended? Through a shift in perception, caused by the way one attends to feelings, using the categories of appropriate attention [see MN 2]. As the Buddha states in DN 21, rather than viewing a feeling as an appealing or unappealing thing, one should look at it as part of a causal process: when a particular feeling is pursued, do skillful or unskillful qualities increase in the mind? If skillful qualities increase, the feeling may be pursued. If unskillful qualities increase, it shouldn't. When comparing feelings that lead to skillful qualities, notice which are more refined: those accompanied with thinking (directed thought) and evaluation, or those free of thinking and evaluation, as in the higher stages of mental absorption, or jhana. When seeing this, there is a tendency to opt for the more refined feelings, and this cuts through the act of thinking that, according to MN 18, provides the basis for papa\u00f1ca."

      "text": "In following this program, the notion of agent and victim is avoided, as is self-reflexive thinking in general. There is simply the analysis of cause-effect processes. One is still making use of dualities \u2014 distinguishing between unskillful and skillful (and affliction/lack of affliction, the results of unskillful and skillful qualities) \u2014 but the distinction is between processes, not things. Thus one's analysis avoids the type of thinking that, according to DN 21, depends on the perceptions and categories of papa\u00f1ca, and in this way the vicious cycle by which thinking and papa\u00f1ca keep feeding each other is cut."

      "text": "Ultimately, by following this program to greater and greater levels of refinement through the higher levels of mental absorption, one finds less and less to relish and enjoy in the six senses and the mental processes based on them. With this sense of disenchantment, the processes of feeling and thought are stilled, and there is a breakthrough to the cessation of the six sense spheres. When these spheres cease, is there anything else left? Ven. Sariputta, in AN 4.174, warns us not to ask, for to ask if there is, isn't, both-is-and-isn't, neither-is-nor-isn't anything left in that dimension is to papa\u00f1cize what is free from papa\u00f1ca. However, this dimension is not a total annihilation of experience. It's a type of experience that DN 11 calls consciousness without feature, luminous all around, where water, earth, fire, & wind have no footing, where long/short, coarse/fine, fair/foul, name/form are all brought to an end. This is the fruit of the path of arahantship \u2014 a path that makes use of dualities but leads to a fruit beyond them."

      "text": "It may come as cold comfort to realize that conflict can be totally overcome only with the realization of arahantship, but it's important to note that by following the path recommended in DN 21 \u2014 learning to avoid references to any notion of \"self\" and learning to view feelings not as things but as parts of a causal process affecting the qualities in the mind \u2014 the basis for papa\u00f1ca is gradually undercut, and there are fewer and fewer occasions for conflict. In following this path, one reaps its increasing benefits all along the way."

      "text": "Translating papa\u00f1ca: As one writer has noted, the word papa\u00f1ca has had a wide variety of meanings in Indian thought, with only one constant: in Buddhist philosophical discourse it carries negative connotations, usually of falsification and distortion. The word itself is derived from a root that means diffuseness, spreading, proliferating. The Pali Commentaries define papa\u00f1ca as covering three types of thought: craving, conceit, and views. They also note that it functions to slow the mind down in its escape from samsara. Because its categories begin with the objectifying thought, \"I am the thinker,\" I have chosen to render the word as \"objectification,\" although some of the following alternatives might be acceptable as well: self-reflexive thinking, reification, proliferation, complication, elaboration, distortion. The word offers some interesting parallels to the postmodern notion of logocentric thinking, but it's important to note that the Buddha's program of deconstructing this process differs sharply from that of postmodern thought."
