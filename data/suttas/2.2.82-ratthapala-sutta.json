The brahmans & householders of Thullakotthita heard it said, \"Gotama the contemplative \u2014 the son of the Sakyans, having gone forth from the Sakyan clan \u2014 has arrived at Thullakotthita. And of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread: 'He is indeed a Blessed One, worthy, & rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge & conduct, well-gone, a knower of the cosmos, an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed, teacher of human & divine beings, awakened, blessed. He has made known \u2014 having realized it through direct knowledge \u2014 this world with its devas, maras, & brahmas, its generations with their contemplatives & brahmans, their rulers & common people. He has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end; has expounded the holy life both in its particulars & in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure. It's good to see such a worthy one.'\""

Some of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and, after an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, sat to one side. Some of them sat to one side having saluted him with their hands palm-to-palm over their hearts. Some of them sat to one side having announced their name & clan. Some of them sat to one side in silence. As they were sitting there, the Blessed One instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged them with a talk on Dhamma."

      "text": "\n1 & 2.\nThe preceding three sentences appear in this location only in the Thai edition of the Canon, although they appear below in all editions of the Canon.\n3.\n This reference to the number of days Ratthapala went without food appears only in the Thai edition of the Canon.\n4.\n This paragraph is not in the Thai edition of the Canon.\n5.\n This first sentence in quotation marks is not in the Thai edition of the Canon.\n6.\n This passage in the Thai edition of the Canon is much more elaborate than the corresponding passage in other editions of the Canon. The other editions mention simply that the father went home and had a heap of gold & silver made and concealed with a screen. The detail of the height of the heaps seems to have been adopted from the Commentary, for the commentators \u2014 in discussing this passage \u2014 feel called upon to explain how tall the piles were. If that detail had been in the original Pali, they wouldn't have had to supply it. As for the two heaps, that detail seems required by the later passage where Ven. Ratthapala's father points out three separate inheritances, although that passage \u2014 as indicated in the translation, mentions \"heap\" in the singular.\n\tApparently there were some discrepancies in the original discourse that subsequent editors tried to correct, but it's hard to reach a definitive conclusion as to which version is closer to the original. On the one hand, it might be that the two extra heaps were mentioned in the original, but later deleted in some editions to bring the description in line with the fact that the later passage mentions \"heap\" in the singular; on the other hand, it might be that the original described the father making one heap, and the editors later amended the passage to account for his later reference to three inheritances.\n\n7.\n This verse is identical with Dhp 147.\n8.\n For the meaning of the word \"world\" in this discourse, see SN 35.82.\n9.\n In ancient Indian medicine, a variety of illnesses \u2014 such as indigestion, sharp pains running through the body, etc. \u2014 were said to be caused by an imbalance of the wind-property (vaayo-dhaatu) in the body.\n"
