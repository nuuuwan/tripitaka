Sariputta defines stress (here and at MN 9 and MN 141), he drops these statements from the definition.\n2.\nThe compilers of the Pali canon used a common theory to explain the physics of heat & motion, meteorology, and the etiology of diseases. That theory centered on the concept of 'dhatu': property or potential. The physical properties presented in this theory were four: those of earth (solidity), liquid, fire, & wind (motion). Three of them \u2014 liquid, fire, & wind \u2014 were viewed as potentially active. When they were aggravated, agitated or provoked \u2014 the Pali term here, 'pakuppati,' was used also on the psychological level, where it meant angered or upset \u2014 they acted as the underlying cause for activity in nature. For more on this topic, see The Mind Like Fire Unbound, Chapter 2.\n3.\nAN 7.46 (quoted in The Mind Like Fire Unbound) cites a wing bone and tendon parings as examples of items that will not catch fire. Perhaps the passage was meant as a comical parody of someone who, having seen another person start fire with a fire stick, tried to imitate that person without understanding the basic principle involved. If you used a fire stick and wood shavings, you would get fire. If you used a wing bone instead of a fire stick, and tendon parings instead of wood shavings, you wouldn't.\n4.\nThis statement has not been traced in any other part of the extant Pali canon.\n5.\nSee SN 12.2.\n6.\nAlthough the fourth noble truth \u2014 the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress \u2014 is not explicitly mentioned in this discussion, it is implicit as the path of practice leading to the subduing of desire & passion, the abandoning of desire & passion for the five clinging-aggregates.\n"
