On arrival, he sat down on a seat laid out. Saccaka the Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha-son, with his own hand, served & satisfied the community of monks headed by the Blessed One with exquisite staple & non-staple food. Then, when the Blessed One had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl, Saccaka the Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha-son, taking a lower seat, sat down to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, \"Master Gotama, may the merit and accoutrements of the merit of this gift be exclusively for the happiness of the donors.\""

      "text": "\n1.\nIn Pali, pa\u1e47\u1e0dita-v\u0101do, \"one who teaches the teaching of the wise.\" Like the sophists (\"wisdom-ists\") of Greece who were near contemporaries of the Buddha, Saccaka claimed to be wise, but his wisdom was largely a matter of debater's tricks. Thus it seems appropriate to adopt the Greek label for him.\n2.\nOne of the five brethren to whom the Buddha delivered his first sermon (SN 56.11). Ven. Assaji was also the person who taught S\u0101riputta the wanderer the brief gist of the Buddha's teaching that immediately inspired S\u0101riputta to attain the Dhamma eye. See Mv 1.23.1-10.\n3.\nAggivessana is Saccaka's clan name.\n4.\nSaccaka is here attempting to appeal to the prejudices of his audience, a cheap debater's trick.\n5.\nAgain, Saccaka is trying to appeal to the vanity of his audience. He doesn't realize, however, that he is setting himself up for a trap. By tying his audience's vanity to the Buddha's analogy, he cannot later deny that the analogy is valid.\n6.\nFollowing the Thai edition here, which reads, \"\u0100gamehi tva\u1e43 Dummukha. \u0100gamehi tva\u1e43 Dummukha. Mukharo'si tva\u1e43 Dummukha.\"  The Burmese edition here reads, \"Just you wait, Dummukha. Just you wait, Dummukha.\" The Sri Lankan edition reads, \"Just you wait, Dummukha. You're a big-mouth, Dummukha.\"\n"
