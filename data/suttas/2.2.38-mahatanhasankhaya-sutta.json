As DN 2 and MN 101 show, some prominent contemplative schools actively rejected the idea of rebirth while others affirmed it. Thus when the Buddha taught rebirth, he wasn't simply following an unexamined cultural assumption. He was consciously taking a stand on one of the controversial issues of his time. However, his explanation of rebirth differed from other schools on both sides of the issue in that he avoided the question of whether or not there's a \"what\" that gets reborn, or if there is a \"what,\" what it is (SN 12.12; SN 12.35). He also discouraged such speculations as, \"If I take rebirth, what was I in the past, and what will I be in the future?\" (MN 2)"

Instead, he focused on the process of how birth happens, because the process involves factors that are immediately apparent to one's awareness throughout life and lie enough under one's control to turn them toward the ending of birth. An understanding of the process as process \u2014 and in particular, as an example of the process of dependent co-arising \u2014 can actually contribute to the end to suffering, because it gives guidance in how to apply the tasks appropriate for the four noble truths to all the factors in the process leading up to birth."

In other words, it avoids any reference to the presence or absence of a self around or a world behind the processes it describes. This allows one to focus directly on the factors of the process as factors, parts of a causal chain. And this, in turn, makes it easier to notice which factors \u2014 such as ignorance \u2014 cause suffering and should thus be abandoned; which ones \u2014 such as attention and intention \u2014 can be converted to the path to the end of suffering, and so should be developed before they, too, are abandoned; and which ones \u2014 such as clinging and becoming \u2014 constitute suffering, and so should be comprehended to the point of disenchantment and dispassion, leading to release."

S\u0101ti states that, in his understanding of the Buddha's teachings, consciousness is the \"what\" that does the wandering on. His fellow monks and then the Buddha treat him and his erroneous view in a way that parallels the way they treat Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha Formerly-of-the-Vulture-Killers in MN 22. First the narrator notes that the view is not merely wrong, but actually evil and pernicious: To adopt it would be to place an obstacle in one's path. The monks try, unsuccessfully, to dissuade S\u0101ti from his view, after which they report the case to the Buddha. The Buddha calls S\u0101ti into his presence, and after ascertaining that S\u0101ti will not abandon his view even when reprimanded by the Buddha himself, he abandons S\u0101ti as too recalcitrant to teach, and turns to cross-question the monks as to the relevant right view of how consciousness functions in the process leading to repeated birth."

Seeing S\u0101ti as a lost cause, the Buddha doesn't want this lost cause to cause further losses among the other monks. We have to remember that during the Buddha's lifetime there were no written accounts of his teachings; the monks and nuns all had to rely on their memory of what they had heard directly from him or through word-of-mouth from fellow members of the Sa\u1e45gha. Thus the Buddha saw the need to establish orthodoxy whenever a member of the Sa\u1e45gha was espousing false interpretations of his teaching."

However, the complexity can be comprehended by keeping in mind that, essentially, the cross-questioning aims at accomplishing two things at once: In providing a correct understanding of consciousness as a conditioned phenomenon, it also shows why the sort of question S\u0101ti was trying to answer is ill-conceived."

If the child \u2014 now an adult \u2014 realizes the limited nature of such an existence, he gains conviction in the need to practice the Dhamma. He becomes a monk, develops virtue and concentration, and then on the basis of his attainment in concentration he approaches the senses in a way that overcomes the limitations experienced by one who approaches them simply for the pursuit of sensual pleasure.
