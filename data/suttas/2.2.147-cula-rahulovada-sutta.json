This phrase, however, is the one point where this sutta deviates from that framework. The corresponding phrase in SN 35.28 focuses exclusively on feelings. The passage here \u2014 vedanagatam, sa\u00f1\u00f1agatam, sankharagatam, vi\u00f1\u00f1anagatam \u2014 focuses on all four mental aggregates. For another example of translating \u2013gatam as \"mode,\" see the phrase \"mode of perception\" (sa\u00f1\u00f1agatam) in MN 121.\n\tSee also: MN 61; MN 62.\n\n"
