The tendency of the mind to proliferate issues from the sense of \"self.\" This term can also be translated as self-reflexive thinking, reification, falsification, distortion, elaboration, or exaggeration. In the discourses, it is frequently used in analyses of the psychology of conflict. The categories of objectification stem from the self-reflexive thought, \"I am the thinker,\" (see Sn 4.14), and include the categories of inappropriate attention (see MN 2): being/not-being, me/not-me, mine/not-mine, doer/done-to. The perceptions of objectification include such thoughts as \"This is me. This is mine. This is my self.\" These perceptions and categories turn back on the person who allows them to proliferate, giving rise to internal conflict & strife, which then expand outward. For more on these terms, see MN 18.\n2.\nFor further discussion of the skillful and unskillful pursuit of these feelings, see MN 101 and MN 137.\n"
